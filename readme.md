# Mollio

Mollio is a simple set of open source html/css templates, released in 2006 by 
[Daemon Internet Consultants](http://www.daemon.com.au). The aim was to create a set of page templates that use 
css for layout **as well as** some sample basic content which has also had some css applied.

## Can I use it on my own project?

Our hope is to make Mollio templates and their derivatives as universal as possible.  In order to help those creating derivative works of Mollio we've agreed to release the templates under three different licenses; 
- [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/)
- [GPL](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/)
- [CPL](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpl1.0.php)
  
As a creator of a derivative work you simply need to choose the license that suits your project.

If you have no idea about licensing or want to know nothing about licensing 
then you are after the Creative Commons license.  Essentially you can do what 
you like as long as you keep the attribution in the HTML - basically a link to 
[Mollio](http://mollio.org) saying where it all began.
